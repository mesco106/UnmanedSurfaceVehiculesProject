# UnmanedSurfaceVehiculesProject
Part of a research project fonded by the National Science Foundation, under the direction of Dr. Leonardo Bobadilla, for his project Extending Autonomy in Seemingly Sensory-Denied Environments Applied to Underwater Robots. Designed and built a mechatronics system for a fleet of small-scale commercial Remote-Control boats to create a test bed to track oceanic coherent structures. Modifications on boats were made to make them small Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) that meet tracking missions for 2D fluid models.
